- **Impact**: Rules created through conversation are not persisted to database
- **Root Cause**: Missing integration between N8N workflow and PostgreSQL storage
- **Status**: Architecture designed, implementation in progress
- **ETA**: Next development sprint

#### 2. Company Context Memory
- **Issue**: Zep memory tracks session memory but not company-specific context
- **Impact**: AI cannot remember company entities across sessions
- **Root Cause**: Knowledge base not yet integrated with conversation system
- **Status**: Knowledge base schema designed, integration pending
- **ETA**: Following rule saving implementation

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Technical Debt

#### 3. Frontend-Database Integration
- **Issue**: Lovable Dev frontend using mock data instead of real database
- **Impact**: Cannot test complete user flows end-to-end
- **Status**: Database integration prompts created, implementation starting

#### 4. Execution Layer Simulation
- **Issue**: EigenLayer agent provides only basic execution simulation
- **Impact**: Cannot test real payment execution flows
- **Status**: Production execution layer design needed after MVP validation

#### 5. Authentication & Multi-Tenancy
- **Issue**: Simple login/password only, no company separation
- **Impact**: Not suitable for production multi-company deployment
- **Status**: Planned for post-MVP implementation
