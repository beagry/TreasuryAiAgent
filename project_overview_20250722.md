# Payment AI - Project Overview

## Executive Summary

Payment AI is an AI-powered treasury automation system designed to revolutionize how companies manage their treasury operations through conversational AI. The system enables treasury managers and CFOs to create, manage, and execute payment automations using natural language, while maintaining enterprise-grade security and compliance.

## Project Architecture

### System Components

The Payment AI system consists of four main components working in harmony:

#### 1. Frontend Interface
- **Platform**: Lovable Dev
- **Technology**: ReactJS with NodeJS backend
- **Design**: ChatGPT-style multi-chat interface
- **Aesthetic**: Professional treasury workspace with deep navy color scheme
- **Target Users**: CFOs, Treasury Managers, Controllers

#### 2. AI Agent System
- **Platform**: N8N (extendable to binary for production)
- **Purpose**: Conversational AI for treasury automation
- **Capabilities**: Educational guidance, progressive learning, safety-first validation
- **Core Functions**: Parameter extraction, rule validation, conversation management

#### 3. Execution Layer
- **Current State**: Emulated by EigenLayer agent
- **Future State**: Custom worker implementation
- **Safety**: 100% structured data execution (not AI-driven in production)
- **Integration**: N8N workflow orchestration

#### 4. Database Layer
- **Platform**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **Architecture**: Hybrid structured + vector data
- **Extension**: pgvector for AI enhancements
- **Purpose**: Rule storage, audit trail, company knowledge

## Core Use Cases

### Supported Automation Types

1. **Contractor Payments**
   - Regular salary/fee distributions
   - Project-based milestone payments
   - Performance-based compensations

2. **Revenue Allocation**
   - Automated profit sharing
   - Revenue distribution to stakeholders
   - Performance-based allocations

3. **Profit Distribution**
   - Shareholder distributions
   - Bonus allocations
   - Reserve fund management

## Current Development Status

- 🔄 AI agent conversation handler

### Known Issues
- ⚠️ AI agent cannot save automations in structured way (in development)
- ⚠️ Zep memory tracks sessions but not company context (being addressed)

## Future Development Roadmap

### Production Must-Haves
- Execute 100% structured data by worker (not AI)
- Comprehensive data saving capabilities
- User authentication and authorization
- Multi-company instance separation
- Security agents for technical data protection

### Later Enhancements
- File upload capabilities (Excel batch payments)
- Company context integration
- One-time payment skip toggles
- Async communication support
- Context limitation handling

### Nice-to-Have Features
- Advanced async communication
- Intelligent context management
- Enhanced reporting and analytics

## Technology Stack

### Development Tools
- **Frontend**: Lovable Dev, ReactJS, NodeJS
- **AI Platform**: N8N (workflow automation)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with pgvector
- **Infrastructure**: Cloud-based with local development support

### Integration Points
- EigenLayer (current execution simulation)
- Zep (session memory management)
- Vector embeddings for company learning
- Audit trail for compliance

## Security & Compliance

### Safety-First Approach
- AI agent never executes real payments
- All executions require explicit human approval
- Comprehensive validation before any action
- Mock execution preview before real execution

### Audit & Compliance
- Complete audit trail for all actions
- User action logging and history
- Compliance export capabilities
- Multi-step confirmation for critical operations

## Repository Structure

The project maintains GitHub repositories for:
- **Lovable Dev Frontend**: ReactJS interface and components
- **N8N Workflows**: AI agent logic and automation workflows
- **Database Scripts**: PostgreSQL setup and maintenance
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation

## 🧪 Testing & Evaluation Requirements

### Critical Testing Before Production
As emphasized in requirements, **100% evaluation testing is mandatory** before any production deployment.

#### Test Categories
1. **AI Agent Evaluation**
   - Parameter extraction accuracy (>95% target)
   - Entity recognition and learning validation
   - Safety constraint enforcement testing
   - Edge case and error handling validation

2. **Frontend Integration Testing**
   - Complete user journey testing
   - API integration validation
   - Real-time chat functionality
   - Database connectivity verification

3. **Execution Layer Testing**
   - Mock execution accuracy validation
   - Safety constraint enforcement
   - Error handling and recovery
   - Performance under load testing

#### Evaluation Process
1. **Test Case Creation**: Comprehensive test cases covering all use cases and edge cases
2. **N8N Execution**: Run all test cases through N8N platform
3. **Result Analysis**: Systematic analysis of AI agent responses and accuracy
4. **Fine-tuning**: Iterative improvement based on test results
5. **Validation**: Final validation before production deployment

### Quality Gates
- **Parameter Extraction**: >95% accuracy across all rule types
- **Safety Validation**: 100% detection of unsafe or invalid inputs
- **User Experience**: <2 second response times, clear communication
- **Integration**: End-to-end workflow completion without errors

## 🚀 Known Issues & Priorities

### 🚨 Critical Issues (Immediate Attention)
1. **AI Agent Rule Saving Bug**: AI creates rules but cannot save to database (in development)
2. **Company Context Memory**: Zep tracks sessions but not company-specific entities (architecture designed)
3. **Frontend-Database Integration**: UI using mock data instead of real database (integration in progress)

### ⚠️ Technical Debt (Next Sprint)
1. **Authentication System**: Simple login only, needs enterprise authentication
2. **Multi-Company Support**: Single tenant only, needs company isolation
3. **Execution Layer**: Basic simulation only, needs production execution framework
